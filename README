This is Business::OnlinePayment::PayConnect, an Business::OnlinePayment backend
module for the PaymentOne (formerly eBillit) PayConnect.  It is only
useful if you have a merchant account with PaymentOne (formerly eBillit):

Currently, only 'LEC' billing is supported.  Eventually credit card and ACH
will be supported as well.

Business::OnlinePayment is a generic interface for processing payments through
online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (If you
like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
solution").
